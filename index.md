    <p>I'm a bioinformatician based at the Imperial College London working in the lab of Prof. Matthew Fisher. I research fungal evolution, particularly the genetics of fungal antimicrobial resistance (fAMR).</p>

    <p>Before joing ICL, I completed my PhD at the University of Manchester (2020-2024) in the Manchester Fungal Infection Group.</p>

    <p>My interests are predominantly focussed on population genetics of *Aspergillus fumigatus* through the construction and analyses of species pangenomes.</p>
