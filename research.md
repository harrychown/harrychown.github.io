## Pangenomes

Since around 2020, fungal pangenomes have expanded substantially in scale, both in the number of genomes per species and in the taxonomic breadth of species studied. Pangenomes enable an unbiased investigation of genomic heterogeneity by analysing the complete set of DNA sequences within a population, rather than relying on comparisons to a single reference genome. This approach allows the genome to be partitioned into core regions, which are conserved across all individuals of a species and accessory regions, which vary between individuals. Numerous studies have linked accessory genomic regions to traits such as virulence and antifungal antimicrobial resistance (fAMR) in fungal pathogens, while the conserved core genome represents a promising source of novel antifungal drug targets.

## Metagenomes and metabarcoding

Fungi are ubiquitous and play highly diverse roles across Earth’s ecosystems. One approach to characterising fungal communities is through the analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA). In principle, shotgun sequencing of all eDNA would allow reconstruction of the complete metagenome of an environment. In practice, however, fungi are often difficult to detect due to their relatively large genome sizes, fragmented DNA and low abundance compared to other microorganisms. As a result, targeted PCR amplification of short, taxonomically informative loci (e.g. ITS, TEF1) is commonly used to generate fungal metabarcodes. These sequences can then be compared against curated reference databases to infer fungal diversity and relative abundance across different environments.

## Fungal evolution and ecology

By integrating pangenomic and metagenomic approaches, it is possible to obtain a comprehensive view of fungal genome evolution and ecological interactions within microbial communities. When combined with sufficiently rich phenotypic and environmental metadata, these methods allow evolutionary and ecological patterns to be interpreted in the context of selective pressures. This framework enables the quantification of how such pressures shape fungal populations and influence their interactions with the surrounding environment.
